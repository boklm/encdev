encdev: mount and unmount encrypted devices
===========================================

encdev is a small command line tool to mount and unmount encrypted
devices, without typing their passwords, using udisks through dbus.

How to use it
-------------

Save the list of your devices with their uuid and password in file
'~/.encdev':

----
devices:
  foo:
     uuid: ced296b5-5fdc-4285-9963-72b8dcba1114
     passwd: some_password
  bar:
     uuid: 0eF3Ey-4hjJ-ijb6-ogiw-WgFh-qwg0-91oKp8
     passwd: some_other_password
----

Check the status of currently plugged devices:
----
$ encdev status
foo: locked
----

Unlock and mount device 'foo':
----
$ encdev mount foo
Unlocked foo
Mounted foo
----

Check the status again:
----
$ encdev status
foo: mounted
----

When you're done using this device, unmount and lock it:
----
$ encdev lock foo
Unmounted foo
Locked foo
----
